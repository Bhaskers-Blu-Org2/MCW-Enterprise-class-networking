# Enterprise-class networking in Azure hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will setup and configure a virtual network with subnets in Azure. You will also learn how to secure the virtual network by deploying a network virtual appliances and configure route tables on the subnets in your virtual network. Additionally, you will set up access to the virtual network with a jump box and a site-to-site VPN connection.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to configure Azure networking components. 


## Overview

You have been asked by Woodgrove Financial Services to provision a proof of concept deployment that will be used by the Woodgrove team to gain familiarity with a complex Virtual Networking deployment, including all of the components that enable the solution. Specifically, the Woodgrove team will be learning about:

-   How to bypass system routing to accomplish custom routing scenarios.

-   How to capitalize on load balancers to distribute load and ensure service availability.

-   How to implement a partner firewall solution to control traffic flow based on policies.

The result of this proof of concept will be an environment resembling this diagram:

## Solution architecture

![This image represents an entire overview of an environment for the result of this proof of concept.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image2.png "Solution architecture")

## Requirements

You must have a working Azure subscription to carry out this hands-on lab step-by-step without a spending cap to deploy the Barracuda firewall from the Azure Marketplace.

## Exercise 3: Create route tables with required routes

Duration: 15 minutes

Route Tables are containers for User Defined Routes (UDRs). The route table is created and associated with a subnet. UDRs allow you to direct traffic in ways other than normal system routes would. In this case, UDRs will direct traffic from 'internal' subnets to the firewall appliance.

### Task 1: Create route tables

1.  On the main portal menu, select **+ Create a Resource**. Type **route** into the search box, and choose **Route tables** then select Create

2.  On the **Create a Route table** blade enter the following information:

    a.  Name: **MgmtRT**

    b.  Subscription: **Choose your subscription**.

    c.  Resource group: Select **Use existing**, choose the drop-down menu, and select **WGVNetRG1**.

    d.  Location: **South Central**

    When the dialog looks like the following screenshot, select Create.
    
    ![This represents completed fields when initially creating a route table.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image36.jpeg "Create route table")

3.  After a few seconds, if the new route table does not show in the portal, select **Refresh**.

4.  After you see the route table you created, complete steps 2 and 3 again to create the **DataRT** route table:

    a.  Name: **DataRT**

    b.  Subscription: **Choose your subscription**.

    c.  Resource group: Select **Use existing**, select the drop-down menu, and select **WGVNetRG2**.

    d.  Location: **south central**

5.  After you see the **DataRT** route table created (you may need to select **Refresh** again), complete steps 2 and 3 again to create the **WebRT** route table:

    a.  Name: **WebRT**

    b.  Subscription: **Choose your subscription**.

    c.  Resource group: Select **Use existing**, choose the drop-down menu, and select **WGVNetRG2**.

    d.  Location: **South Central**

6.  Once route tables are created, your **Route tables** blade should look like the following screenshot:

    ![Route Table listing.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Enterprise-classnetworkinginAzureimages/media/image38.jpeg "Route table link")

### Task 2: Add routes to each route table

1.  Select on the **DataRT** route table, and choose **Routes**.
